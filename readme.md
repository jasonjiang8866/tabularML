# Generic Machine Learning Pipeline

This repository contains a versatile machine learning pipeline, exemplified with a housing price prediction task. While the current implementation is tailored to housing price prediction, the structure is designed to be adaptable for various other prediction tasks with minor modifications.

## Overview

The pipeline follows these main steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Loads the dataset. In the example, housing datasets such as California and Ames are used.
2. **Data Exploration:** Explores the dataset to understand its characteristics.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Processes the data to ensure it is suitable for modeling.
4. **Train-Test Split:** Divides the dataset into training and testing subsets.
5. **Feature Selection:** Uses RandomForestRegressor to identify significant features. This step can be adapted for other feature selection methods.
6. **Model Building:** Constructs a predictive model. The example uses the LightGBM algorithm, but other algorithms can be substituted.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizes model parameters. GridSearchCV is employed in the example.
8. **Model Evaluation:** Assesses the model's performance using various metrics.
9. **Model Saving:** Serializes the trained model for deployment or future use.

## Libraries Utilized

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- LightGBM
- joblib

## Usage

To execute this pipeline, run:

\```
python pipeline.py
\```

For adapting this pipeline to other tasks, users may need to adjust data loading, preprocessing, and the choice of machine learning algorithm as per the specific requirements.
